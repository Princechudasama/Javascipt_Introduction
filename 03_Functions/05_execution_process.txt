Javascript execution context

code file      =>  1.Global execution context(This keyword)
3 type of context  2.Function execution context
                   3.eval execution context

code file =>1.Memory creation phase
          =>2.execution phase
        
//let val1 = 10;
//let val2 = 20;
//Function addNum(num1,num2){
    let total = num1 + num2
    return total
//};
//let result1 = addNum(val1,val2)
//let result2 = addNum(10,2)
   

1.Global execution =>  This

2.Memory phase
    val1 = undefined;
    val2 = undefined;
    addNum = definition;
    result1 = undefined;
    result2 = undefined;

3.execution phase (line no 17);
    val1 = 10;
    val2 = 5;
    addNum --------->  new variable environment + 
                      execution thread   ---->after run
                                          whole context is  deleted.         
result = 15 (total)
for another     |        1. Memory phase
Function orblock |            num1 = undefined;
it works as same |            num2 = undefined;
                |           total = undefined;
                |
                |------- 2.execution phase
                            num1 = val1 = 10;
                            num2 = val2 = 5;
                            total = 15
